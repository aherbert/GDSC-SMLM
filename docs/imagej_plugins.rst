ImageJ Plugins Overview
=======================

The various ``ImageJ`` plugins allow the processing of single-molecule light microscopy images and analysis of the results. This includes:

*   Finding and fitting spots on the image
*   Reconstructing an image from the list of localisations
*   Analysis of the blinking rate of fluorophores
*   Tracing of fluorophore molecules through time

The plugins used to analyse a set of localisations only require that the localisations be loaded into memory. The localisations do not have to be computed by the SMLM fitting plugins and can be generated by another program. For example it is possible to read the following file formats for analysis:

*   rapidSTORM
*   Nikon NSTORM
*   MicroManager Tagged Spot File (`TSF <https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Tagged_Spot_File_(tsf)_format>`_)

The plugins have been divided into the following sub-sets:

   * - Set
     - Description

   * - Fitting
     - For identification of localisations on an image.

   * - Results
     - Allow loading and saving results in different formats. Results can be filtered to subsets and compared to a reference set, e.g. for benchmarking.

   * - Analysis
     - Perform analysis on localisations for example blinking rate estimation, molecule tracing and Fourier image resolution.

   * - PC PALM
     - Plugins for Pair Correlation (PC) analysis.

   * - Model
     - Simulate single-molecule images.

   * - Calibration
     - Estimate PSF widths and allow calibration of the imaging camera noise and gain.

   * - Tools
     - Utility plugins for image manipulation.

   * - Toolset
     - For install of the SMLM Toolset and configuration of the SMLM Tools window.
